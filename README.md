# App Store Project

Welcome to the App Store, a project showcasing a simple web-based application store interface. Users can browse featured, trending, recommended, and all available applications. Each application has a dedicated details page with descriptions, ratings, screenshots, and a download link.

## Features

- **Homepage:** Displays various categories of apps like Featured, Trending, and Recommended.
- **App Listings:** Grid view of applications with icons, names, categories, and ratings.
- **App Details Page:** Shows comprehensive information about each app, including a banner, detailed description, version, category, rating, price (currently all free), and download button.
- **Responsive Design:** Adapts to different screen sizes for a good user experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

## Screenshots

Here are a couple of example screenshots from one of the apps:
